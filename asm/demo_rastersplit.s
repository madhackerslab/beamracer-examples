; More advanced implementation of rasterbars that relies on
; VASYL programming to divide work between main CPU and VASYL,
; thus achieving much better performance.
;
; Basically identical to demo_rasterbars.s sans the extra
; code to handle right-hand side bar splits.
;
; Since VASYL code makes active use of both ports, it is critical
; that the CPU accesses to port 0 do not overlap with VASYL's. Here it is
; achieved by performing CPU's work in rasterlines 0 to 10. At that time VASYL
; is doing nothing but WAIT-ing.
